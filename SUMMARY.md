# Project Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to improve the BBC News Classification project.

## Files Removed

The following files were deleted to clean up the project:

1. `notebook_update_guide.md` - Unnecessary guide file as the project is already using the appropriate dataset
2. `KAGGLE_DATASET_KULLANIM_KILAVUZU.md` - Redundant guide file about Kaggle dataset usage
3. `Report&PPT/AIDS_Project_ppt_group_5_subgroup_4.pdf` - Unrelated PDF file from a different project
4. `Report&PPT/AIDS_Project_Report_group_5_subgroup_4.pdf` - Unrelated PDF file from a different project

## Files Updated

1. `PRESENTATION.md` - Enhanced with more details about Word2Vec model implementation:
   - Added "Why Word2Vec?" section explaining the advantages
   - Added "Word2Vec Visualizations" section describing t-SNE visualization
   - Added "Word2Vec Impact" section detailing performance improvements
   - Added more specific Word2Vec implementation details (window size, min count, etc.)
   - Added information about parameter fine-tuning

2. `README.md` - Completely restructured and improved:
   - Made it more concise and focused
   - Added a dedicated Word2Vec implementation section
   - Added detailed repository structure
   - Improved formatting with tables for results
   - Simplified usage instructions
   - Removed redundant sections and Turkish language content

3. `PROJE_KURULUM_VE_CALISTIRMA_REHBERI.md` - Renamed header to English "Project Setup and Usage Guide" for consistency

## Remaining Files

All core project files were preserved:
- `app.py` - Streamlit web application
- `bbc_news_classification_with_word2vec.ipynb` - Main notebook
- `extract_word2vec_features.py` - Word2Vec feature extraction
- `train_with_smote.py` - SMOTE training script
- `calculate_readability_scores.py` - Text analysis script
- `plot_readability_scores.py` - Visualization script
- `download_nltk_resources.py` - NLTK resource downloader
- `prepare_kaggle_dataset.py` - Dataset preparation script
- `PROJECT_REPORT.md` - Detailed project report
- `PRESENTATION.md` - Presentation slides in markdown
- `models/` directory with trained models
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies file

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Run all scripts to verify functionality after cleanup
2. Consider translating all remaining Turkish comments in code to English
3. Add comments to the notebook explaining Word2Vec implementation details
4. Create a more detailed example walkthrough in the README

## Final State

The project is now cleaner, more focused, and better documents the Word2Vec implementation, which was an important component of the classification pipeline. The presentation has been enhanced to highlight the Word2Vec model's importance and impact on the classification task.
