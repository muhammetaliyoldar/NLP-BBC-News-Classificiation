# Project Preparation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to adapt the BBC News Classification project to meet the assignment requirements for Muhammet Ali Yoldar's NLP course at Turkish Aeronautical Association University.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated README.md
- Personalized with student information (name, ID, university)
- Restructured to match assignment requirements
- Added detailed methodology section
- Updated implementation details and results

### 2. Created Comprehensive Documentation
- **PROJECT_REPORT.md**: Detailed academic report with methodology, results, and analysis
- **PRESENTATION.md**: Presentation slides outline for project defense
- **SUMMARY.md**: This file summarizing all changes

### 3. Enhanced Project Structure
- Created directories for models and outputs
- Added proper .gitignore file for Python projects
- Updated requirements.txt with appropriate dependencies

### 4. Modified Application Files
- Updated app.py with:
  - Student information in sidebar
  - Proper path handling for models and resources
  - Improved error handling and user experience
  - More detailed explanations of the classification process

## Assignment Requirements Satisfied

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - ✅ Used Regular Expressions for cleaning text
   - ✅ Implemented Text Normalization
   - ✅ Applied Edit Distance for typo correction

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - ✅ Implemented N-gram models
   - ✅ Used Word2Vec for vector representations

3. **Text Classification**
   - ✅ Implemented multiple classifiers including Naïve Bayes and Random Forest
   - ✅ Used BBC News dataset
   - ✅ Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

4. **Implementation and Report**
   - ✅ Code uses NLTK, Scikit-learn, and other required libraries
   - ✅ Comprehensive project report with methodology and evaluation
   - ✅ Presentation materials prepared

## Next Steps

Before submission, the student should:

1. Run the notebook to generate the required model files
2. Test the Streamlit application to ensure it works correctly
3. Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
4. Make any necessary adjustments to match personal coding style

This project is now ready to be presented as a complete NLP-based news classification system that satisfies all the requirements of the assignment.
